*  If you want to get a flight going, post it up here and see who's interested. In general, lets try to make our severs named as such so we can find each other in the server browser easily:

    **Hoggit-<your username>**

    ** The dedicated sever will always have /r/hoggit and dedicated somewhere in the name.

Our standard password is **hoggit1fw**. Just something to keep randoms out and from destroying everything in sight.
